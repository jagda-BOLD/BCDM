# Barcode Core Data Model(BCDM)
<br>
This repository hosts the reference implementation of the Barcode Core Data Model, a standardized format aimed at significantly enhancing the organization, sharing, and utilization of DNA barcode data within the biodiversity science community. The model defines key terms and their definitions for describing crucial details about DNA barcodes, including sequences, specimens, taxonomic names, locations, dates, and related metadata. Furthermore, the repository includes mappings to other data standards commonly used in the biodiversity community. It serves as a basis for developing analytical tools, databases, and resources leveraging DNA barcode data, thus enabling new avenues for research and education.
<br>
The BCDM is based on the [Frictionless Data Framework](https://frictionlessdata.io), a FAIR compliant data packaging solution that lowers barriers to data uptake.


## Core Features
- Alignment with existing biodiversity data models and databases, including the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) and Darwin Core Data, streamlining data exchange.

- Comprehensive coverage of essential data elements related to DNA based species identification, including specimen collection, DNA sequences, and taxonomic classification.

- Establishment of a common vocabulary for data interpretation

- Serve as a foundation for the development of analytical tools, databases, and resources that utilize DNA barcode data, opening new avenues for research and education.


## Field Definitions 
The [definitions](field_definitions.tsv) format for the current supported fields included in the Barcode Core Data Model (BCDM) with data types and data formats specified.

  
  |**Column name** | **Definition**|
  | :----------|:---------|
  |field| Standardized/universal name for the data field.|
  |data_type|  Data type of the field. For example: integer, float,string, and string:date|
  |data_format| Additional formatting constraint for the data value. For example: a timestamp field may follow this format `%d-%b-%y`; default indicates no extra formatting constraint specified. | 
  |definition | Meaning of the term, including their controlled vocabulary when applicable. |

## Mappings To Other Data Models & Databases
 
 1. **mapping_BCDM_to_DWC.tsv**: This document provides the mapping of the BCDM to Darwin Core standard. Not all BCMD fields have an equivalent term in the Darwin Core standard some fields are ommitted during mapping or conversion. DarwinCore field definitions can be found in the following link: [Darwin Reference Guide] (https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/)
 
<br>

  
  |**Column name** | **Definition**|
  | :----------|:---------|
  |bcdm_field | BCDM field name.|
  |dwc_field | Corresponding term in the Darwin Core glossary.|
  |bcdm_type|Data type of the field as in the BCDM. For example: integer, float,string, and string:date |
  |bcdm_format| Additional formatting constraint for the data value as in the BCDM. For example: a timestamp field may follow this format `%d-%b-%y`; default indicates no extra formatting constraint specified.  |
  |dwc_type| Data type of the Darwin Core field as specified in the standard.|
  |dwc_format| Additional formatting constraint for the data value as specified in the Darwin Core standard.|

## Planned Actions

- Add required fields
- Add regex rules for basic validation
